    <h1> RULES FOR PLAYING THE GAME.</h1>
    <P>Charades is a game of pantomimes: you have to "act out" a phrase without speaking, while the other members of your team try to guess what the phrase is.<BR>
       The objective is for your team to guess the phrase as quickly as possible.</P>
    <h2>Equipment Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>an internet connection</li>
        <li>a working device(phone, tablet or laptop)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The players divide into two teams</li>
        <li>Each team in turn gets a “secret” word or phrase, to be guessed by the other team. <br>
            Rules vary as to which phrases are allowed; single words may be restricted to nouns as found in dictionaries,<br>
             while multi-word phrases usually are required to be commonly used phrases, or common expressions for well-known concepts. Often the secret phrases allowed are confined to titles of books, songs, or movies.</li>
        <li>The actor then has a limited period of time in which to convey the secret phrase to the guessers by pantomime.</li>
        <li>The actor may not make any sounds or lip movements. In some circles, even clapping is prohibited, while in others, the player may make any sound other than speaking or whistling a recognizable tune.</li>
        <li>The actor cannot point out at any of the objects present in the scene, if by doing so they are helping their teammates</li>
        <li>The guessers attempt to guess the word or phrase based on the actor’s performance. They can ask questions, to which the actor may give non-verbal responses, such as nodding in affirmation. If any of the guessers says the correct word or phrase within the time limit in the literal form as written on the slip, their team wins that round; if the phrase is not guessed when the time limit expires, the team that produced the secret phrase wins the round.</li>
        <li>The teams alternate until each team member has had an opportunity to be the actor.</li>
    </ul>
