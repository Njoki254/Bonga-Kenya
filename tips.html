        <p>Bonga Charades is a Kenyan parlor or party word guessing game. Originally, the game was a dramatic form of literary charades: a single person would act out <br> 
            each syllable of a word or phrase in order, followed by the whole phrase together, while the rest of the group guessed</p>

        <h2>Rules of the game.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two teams divided into equal players</li>
            <li>A time and score keeper is selected, usually a person not taking part or else one person from each team can take turns</li>
            <li>No words. No pointing at objects in a room. No lip movements.</li>
            <li>Only "acting out" words or pantomiming similar sounding words.</li>
            <li>The team demonstrating the act choose their actor, no actor may act more than once until all team members had a chance to be the actor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How to beat your opponent.</h1>
        <h2>A cheatsheet of sorts!</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>“A” is signed by steepling index fingers together. Following it with either <br>
                the stretching rubber band sign or “close, keep guessing!” sign, will often elicit “an” and “and”. (sometimes “and” is signed by pointing at ones palm with the index finger)</li>
            <li>“I” is signed by pointing at one’s eye, or one’s chest.</li>
            <li>“The” is signed by making a “T” sign with the index fingers. The “close, keep guessing!” sign will then usually elicit a rigmarole of other very common words starting with “th”.</li>
            <li>Pretending to paddle a canoe can be used to sign the word “or.”</li>
            <li>Pointing to the ear means “sounds like”</li>
            <li>The actor has limited time (2-3 minutes) to act out the phrase to his own team.</li>
            <li>The actor can make any gestures to act out the word.</li>

        </ul>
